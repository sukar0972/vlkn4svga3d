# Publication checks — 2026-09-23

A separate source snapshot was built without using the development directory's existing object files.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `make -j4 all` | Passed; compiler warnings remain |
| `make test` | Passed, including 3,407 mock-engine assertions |
| `make acceptance` | Passed all stages of the existing runner |

The real-Vulkan driver check identified Mesa llvmpipe (LLVM 20.1.2, 256 bits), Vulkan API 1.4.318, software rendering, mock fallback disabled, and validation layers enabled. That check reported zero validation errors and warnings.

These results describe the current tests, not an independent certification of their coverage. The QEMU integration executable is an in-process device harness, not a booted guest. No real VM was booted or modified during publication. Prior live-guest investigation produced a black framebuffer; this snapshot does not claim that issue is fixed. Hardware-GPU performance and broad guest compatibility remain unverified.

Build and test transcripts from this snapshot are in `validation/`.
